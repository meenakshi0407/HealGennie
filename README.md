# HealGennie

The goal of this project is to create a chatbot that can understand and respond to user input based on intents. The chatbot is built using Natural Language Processing (NLP) library and Logistic Regression, to extract the intents and entities from user input. The chatbot is built using Streamlit, a Python library for building interactive web applications.

Project Overview:
The project is divided into two parts:

NLP techniques and Logistic Regression algorithm is used to train the chatbot on labeled intents and entities.
For building the Chatbot interface, Streamlit web framework is used to build a web-based chatbot interface. The interface allows users to input text and receive responses from the chatbot.
Dataset:
The dataset used in this project is a collection of labelled intents and entities. The data is stored in a list.

Intents: The intent of the user input (e.g. "greeting", "How can I lose weight?", "about")
Entities: The entities extracted from user input (e.g. "Hi", "How much I drink water?", "I have anxiety?")
Text: The user input text.
